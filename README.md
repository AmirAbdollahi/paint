# Paint Application (C#)

Welcome to my **Paint** application â€” one of the first major challenges I tackled when I started learning **C#**. This project holds a special place in my journey as a developer, and it's a fun attempt to simulate the basic functionality of the classic **MS Paint** application.

## Features

- Draw lines, rectangles, ellipses, and freehand shapes
- Change pen color and thickness
- Fill shapes with colors
- Erase content
- Clear canvas
- Save your drawing

## Screenshots


## Tech Stack

- Language: **C#**
- Framework: **.NET Framework (WinForms)**

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirAbdollahi/paint.git
   ```

2. Open the solution file (`Paint.sln`) in **Visual Studio**.

3. Build and run the project.

## Motivation

This was a self-challenge project during my early days of learning C#. I wanted to explore how to handle **graphics**, **user input**, and **WinForms** events. It helped me gain a deeper understanding of Windows desktop development and UI rendering.

## What I Learned

- Drawing on `Graphics` objects
- Managing user interactions like mouse movements
- Handling UI components and events in WinForms
- Basics of color and shape manipulation in a GUI

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the classic **Microsoft Paint** and my curiosity about how drawing tools work behind the scenes.

## Contribution

Feel free to explore, fork, or improve this project. I'd love to see what you come up with!
